# Abstract

# Problem
- Lack of large, high-quality (i.e., representative) public datasets
- Inability to “scrape” the internet for creating public datasets
- Data generation from cycle-level simulators is slow and difficult
- Rapidly evolving ML algorithms landscape
- Unclear applicability of ML algorithms to architecture problems
- Need for agile full-stack co-design
- Difficulty with verifying, validating, and interpreting ML algorithms for system design
